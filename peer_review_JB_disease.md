# Homework 10

You will fill out the following
questionnaire for each program and submit the answers as your final homework. You will
also share your questionnaire with the group that created the program __by the end of discussion__.

### The Readme

#### 1. Is the Readme file the first document displayed upon lading the Github?  Does this Readme page include a title, and the name and contact information for all project members?
- the readme was the first document displayed. It includes a title and names for the project members, but does not have their contact information. I also think they accidentally turned that into a table instead of creating headers?
#### 2. Is the purpose of this program clear from the Introduction?  What -in your own words- is the motivation behind the program.
- the purpose written is clear, but I think it could use a little more detail. Their modle looks at how infection, susceptibility, and resistance/removal rate affects diseases.
#### 3. Is there a program workflow and is it easy to understand?  What -in your own words- is the program workflow?
- There is a program workflow. the workflow is not easy to understand. it does not go through the steps of their code, and I think they had formatting issues with the markdown.
#### 4. Are the dependencies indicated in the workflow?  If there are Hoffman2 specific requirements are they indicated?
- there are depndencied. this is a shiny app and doesn't require hoffman, or at least it does not say.
#### 5. Are there instructions for running the program?  Do the instructions make sense?  What would you do to improve the instructions?
- the instructions for running the program are not very clear, as it is just a link to the website. I don't really know how to use their shiny app. I would make it clear how a user should input their data.
#### 6. Is there a section that indicates the files and directories produced by the program?
- there is an expected output section, which tells you that the program will show you your results on the graph. however, the variables for the trhee different colored lines in the graph are abbreviated, but it is not stated in the program or readme what the abbreviations stand for.
#### 7. Are the research programs / motivations for the program cited?  Are the dependencies cited?
- they appear to be cited.

### The Scripts

#### 8. Is there a directory that contains all of the program scripts?
	There is not a directory, but there is a link to the app website and a R script.
#### 9. Do these programs generate a run log?
	both the website and the R script work fine, i think they could be clarified a bit more.

### The Vignette
THERE WAS NO VIGNETTE
#### 10. Is there a directory called Vignette and does it include a test set, the commands used to run the program and the expected output databases?

#### 11. Where you able to run the Vignette using the small test dataset? If not what errors did you get?  If so was it easy to run the dataset?  Where the instructions clear.

#### 12. Where you able to reproduce the expected output?  If not what was different.
---

### General

#### 13. Give __at least two__ suggestions for ways to improve the GitHub page or the operation of the program.
	The program workflow and the instructions need to be more clear. It is difficult to understand how the code/program works and how to run it yourself.
