You will fill out the following
questionnaire for each program and submit the answers as your final homework. You will
also share your questionnaire with the group that created the program __by the end of discussion__.

### The Readme

#### 1. Is the Readme file the first document displayed upon lading the Github?  Does this Readme page include a title, and the name and contact information for all project members?
####	The readme file is the first document displayed, includes a 
####	title, and contains the name for the project members. Their 
####	contact information is not provided.
#### 2. Is the purpose of this program clear from the Introduction?  What -in your own words- is the motivation behind the program.
####	The purpose of the program is clear from the introduction. The program seeks to create physics graphs helpful for introductory students in physics to see the relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration.
#### 3. Is there a program workflow and is it easy to understand?  What -in your own words- is the program workflow?
####	There is a program workflow, and it is easy to understand. The program workflow is that the program creates 50 order pairs from each of the three equations and then creates the plot.
#### 4. Are the dependencies indicated in the workflow?  If there are Hoffman2 specific requirements are they indicated?
####	There are dependencies in the workflow. There is a link mentioned, but not provided. There is no Hoffman2 specific requirements.
#### 5. Are there instructions for running the program?  Do the instructions make sense?  What would you do to improve the instructions?
####	There are instructions, but they are not complete so they do not make sense. The instructions need to be complete in order for a user to use the program.
#### 6. Is there a section that indicates the files and directories produced by the program?
####	There is a section that indicates the diles and directories that should be produced by the program.
#### 7. Are the research programs / motivations for the program cited?  Are the dependencies cited?
####	The research programs/motivations for the programs are not cited.

### The Scripts

#### 8. Is there a directory that contains all of the program scripts?
#### There are two folders with several program scripts in them.

#### 9. Do these programs generate a run log?

---

### The Vignette

#### 10. Is there a directory called Vignette and does it include a test set, the commands used to run the program and the expected output databases?
####	There is not a directory called Vignette, but there is a directory that includes a test set, there does not appear to be any commands to run the program, and the instructions are not complete. There does not appear to be an expected output databases.
#### 11. Where you able to run the Vignette using the small test dataset? If not what errors did you get?  If so was it easy to run the dataset?  Where the instructions clear.
####	I was not able to run the Vignette because the instructions were not complete, so I do not know how to use the script.
#### 12. Where you able to reproduce the expected output?  If not what was different.
####	The expected output is not given, and I do not know how to run the code because the instructions are not complete.

### General

#### 13. Give __at least two__ suggestions for ways to improve the GitHub page or the operation of the program.
####	There needs to be complete, clear instructions, and the Vignette directory needs to be created so that users can know what folder to use to test the program.
